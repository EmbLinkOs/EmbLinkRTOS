### Changed (request lanes, 2026-11-09)

- A114, proposed: a device has two request lanes, each its own first-in-first-out queue whose head starts whatever the other lane does, so a full-duplex device writes while it reads. A request names its lane (`emb_drv_request_t.lane`, 0 by default); a device that needs one lane behaves as before ([amendments](docs/specs/AMENDMENTS-M4.md)).
